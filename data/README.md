# Data

This folder contains a script for downsampling the gaze file output of E-Prime/Tobii, and downsampled results of the experiments.

Data is downsampled by binning fixations into bins of length 10ms, starting at the onset of the initial consonant.
The script outputs a table in CSV format, encoding the number of fixations to the target, the distractor, or other pictures during each time window.
